## Components

SmartFactory consists of the following components:

- **Knowledge Base**: A database that stores information about the various KPIs and machines in the factory.
- **Data Storage**: A data storage system that stores the data generated by the machines, and other relevant information.
- **Data Processing**: A data processing system that processes the data generated by the machines for analysis on trends and patterns.
- **API**: An API that provides access to the data stored in the various components of the system.
- **RAG and Generative AI**: A system that interacts with the user to provide insights and dashboards based on the data generated by the machines.
- **GUI**: A web-based GUI that allows users to interact with the system and access the insights and dashboards generated by the RAG and Generative AI system.
- **KPI Engine**: A system that calculates the KPIs based on the data generated by the machines.

Each of these components can be individually explored by reading their README in their respective directories.

## Features

- **Monitoring**: Track the status of machines and production lines.
- **Data Analytics**: Analyze production data to identify bottlenecks and optimize workflows.
- **Remote Control**: Manage factory operations remotely through a secure web interface.
